# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PS-API project aims to provide a RESTful API for accessing product specifications stored in a DynamoDB database. The system will handle flexible JSON schemas for product data including product names, categories, brands, and other specifications. The API will serve as a backend service for applications requiring product information retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store product specifications in a DynamoDB database with flexible JSON schema, so that I can accommodate various product types and attributes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system initializes THE SYSTEM SHALL create a DynamoDB table for product specifications
2. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL support flexible JSON schema with at minimum product name, category, and brand fields
3. WHEN sample data is provided THE SYSTEM SHALL populate the database with representative product records
4. WHEN the database is queried THE SYSTEM SHALL return product data in consistent JSON format

### Requirement 2: API Endpoint for Product Retrieval
**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve product specifications via REST API, so that I can display product information to end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a GET request is made to /products THE SYSTEM SHALL return all product specifications
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /products/{id} THE SYSTEM SHALL return a specific product by ID
3. WHEN an invalid product ID is requested THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message
4. WHEN the API is called THE SYSTEM SHALL return data in JSON format with proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 3: Sample Data Management
**User Story:** As a developer, I want sample product data automatically populated in the database, so that I can test and demonstrate the API functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system deploys THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically create sample product records
2. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include diverse product categories and brands
3. WHEN sample data is queried THE SYSTEM SHALL return realistic product specifications
4. WHEN the API endpoint is triggered THE SYSTEM SHALL successfully retrieve and return sample data

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Validation
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want proper error handling and validation, so that I can handle failures gracefully in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN invalid requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes
2. WHEN database errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL return 500 status with error message
3. WHEN malformed requests are received THE SYSTEM SHALL return 400 status with validation details
4. WHEN the system is unavailable THE SYSTEM SHALL return 503 status with retry information

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability
**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the API to perform efficiently under load, so that it can handle production traffic requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 2 seconds per request
2. WHEN the database is queried THE SYSTEM SHALL use efficient DynamoDB query patterns
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THE SYSTEM SHALL implement proper connection pooling
4. WHEN traffic increases THE SYSTEM SHALL scale automatically with AWS infrastructure
