# Jira Stories for PS-API-20251029-122312

## Story 1: API Gateway Setup
**Summary:** Set up API Gateway with RESTful endpoints for product specification management

**Description:** 
As a system architect, I want to set up an API Gateway with RESTful endpoints so that external clients can access product specification data through a secure and scalable interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API Gateway is configured with RESTful API design
- Resource-based routing is implemented
- API key authentication is enabled
- Request throttling is configured
- CORS is enabled for cross-origin requests
- HTTPS enforcement is implemented

**Endpoints to implement:**
- GET /products - Retrieve all products
- GET /products/{id} - Retrieve specific product by ID

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use AWS API Gateway REST API
- Configure appropriate IAM roles and policies
- Enable CloudWatch logging for monitoring
- Set up proper error handling and response formats

## Story 2: Lambda Functions Development
**Summary:** Develop Lambda functions for product data retrieval operations

**Description:**
As a backend developer, I want to create Lambda functions that handle product data operations so that the API can efficiently process requests and return product specifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `getProducts` function retrieves all products from DynamoDB
- `getProductById` function retrieves specific product by ID
- `initializeData` function populates sample data on deployment
- All functions use Node.js latest LTS version
- Proper error handling and logging implemented
- Connection pooling for DynamoDB operations
- Minimal cold start impact with lightweight dependencies

**Technical Requirements:**
- Node.js runtime environment
- IAM roles with least privilege access to DynamoDB
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Memory allocation optimized for workload
- Input validation and sanitization

## Story 3: DynamoDB Table Design and Implementation
**Summary:** Create DynamoDB table for product specifications storage

**Description:**
As a data architect, I want to design and implement a DynamoDB table that efficiently stores product specifications with flexible schema capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Table named `ProductSpecifications` is created
- Primary key is `productId` (String)
- Required attributes: productId, productName, category, brand, specifications, createdAt, updatedAt
- Flexible JSON specifications object for additional attributes
- On-demand billing configuration
- Encryption at rest enabled
- Efficient query patterns using primary key

**Technical Requirements:**
- DynamoDB table with proper indexing
- Consistent read operations for data accuracy
- Performance monitoring with CloudWatch
- Backup and recovery strategy

## Story 4: API Response Format Standardization
**Summary:** Implement consistent API response format across all endpoints

**Description:**
As an API consumer, I want all API responses to follow a consistent JSON structure so that I can reliably parse and handle responses from different endpoints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Success responses include: success (boolean), data (object/array), message (string), timestamp (ISO8601)
- Error responses include: success (false), error object with code and message, timestamp (ISO8601)
- All timestamps are in ISO8601 format
- Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- Consistent error codes and messages

**Technical Requirements:**
- Response formatting middleware/utility functions
- Error handling middleware
- HTTP status code mapping
- Response validation

## Story 5: Sample Data Initialization
**Summary:** Create sample data initialization for product categories

**Description:**
As a system administrator, I want the system to initialize with realistic sample data so that the API can be tested and demonstrated with meaningful product specifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Sample data includes 4 categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports & Outdoors
- Each category contains 3-5 sample products
- Products have realistic specifications demonstrating flexible schema
- Data initialization triggered on deployment
- Sample products include: smartphones, laptops, tablets, shirts, pants, shoes, furniture, appliances, tools, sports equipment

**Technical Requirements:**
- Automated data seeding process
- Flexible product specification examples
- Category-based organization
- Realistic product attributes and specifications

## Story 6: Security Implementation
**Summary:** Implement comprehensive security measures for the API

**Description:**
As a security engineer, I want to implement robust security measures so that the product specification API is protected against unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API Gateway requires API key authentication
- Lambda execution roles follow least privilege principle
- DynamoDB encryption at rest is enabled
- HTTPS enforcement for all API calls
- Input validation and sanitization implemented
- VPC endpoints configured (optional enhancement)

**Technical Requirements:**
- IAM roles and policies configuration
- API key management
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Input validation middleware
- Security headers implementation

## Story 7: Monitoring and Logging Setup
**Summary:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging for system observability

**Description:**
As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up comprehensive monitoring and logging so that I can track system performance, identify issues, and maintain system health.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CloudWatch integration for Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Error rate monitoring and alerting
- Performance threshold monitoring
- Custom application metrics for business logic
- Access logs and performance metrics

**Technical Requirements:**
- CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Metric collection and visualization
- Alert notification setup
